        <h2>A second post</h2>
        <h3>2024-09-14</h3>
        <p>Today at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/open-source-saturday-milano/events/302710633/?eventOrigin=home_page_upcoming_events$inPerson">Open Source Saturday #54</a>
I implemented (badly) the minimal functionality required to be able to publish a second blogpost,
to list all posts and to support a very minimal navigation (and an essential about page).</p>
<p>If you want a description in English on what is Open Source Saturday format read about it in <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-day/">Loris's blogpost</a>. He was sitting next to me today.</p>
<p>Before today there was <a href="../posts/recursing0.html">a single post here</a>, with no nav and nothing else.</p>
