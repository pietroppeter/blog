Today at [Open Source Saturday #54](https://www.meetup.com/open-source-saturday-milano/events/302710633/?eventOrigin=home_page_upcoming_events$inPerson)
I implemented (badly) the minimal functionality required to be able to publish a second blogpost,
to list all posts and to support a very minimal navigation (and an essential about page).

If you want a description in English on what is Open Source Saturday format read about it in [Loris's blogpost](https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-day/). He was sitting next to me today.

Before today there was [a single post here](@root/posts/recursing0.html), with no nav and nothing else.
