## Recursing: step 0

Yesterday was my last day as ‚ÄúHappily Unemployed‚Äù (_felicemente disoccupato_).

Roughly 4 months ago I resigned. I was close to reaching 9 years of growth and joys and sorrows (of life, one would say) at the same company. It has been a very nice _percorso_ (or [_camino_] in Spanish; not sure what would the best word in English here, path doesn't sound to me it captures the sense of travel). I have met a number of beautiful people there. It was time for a change.

Shortly before resigning I watched an interview of [Salvatore] Sanfilippo where he states the following four rules that have helped him conduct himself throughout the years:

1. Go deep
2. Nulla die sine linea
3. Work on something that matters
4. Be kind

These rules look like a nice tool for thought to keep in mind.

This last month of October, actually this last 4 weeks of being happily unemployed, have been a special period. I focused on resting, taking care of myself and my family and prepare for the next steps. I have met even more people through some wonderful tech communities. I was surprised by how many things you have to do when you do not actually have anything you *really* **have to** do. Of course I planned for more than I could chew, took a hit and realized I should just enjoy this period. I did. This last week was nothing short of amazing.

Today I start [recursing].

I will say more about that, but the most practical matter at the moment is that I will need to change my schedule. I will have to be working with other people mostly in the late afternoon and in the evening. This is the first challenge.

Have a good day y‚Äôall! üòä
